            <p>
              I like trying lots of new foods and eating out. I also have done
              some brewing and enjoy learning to make new cocktails.

              I enjoy singing in choirs and have missed that during the pandemic
              - it's not the same online.

            <p>
              It's now been three years since my last big adventure (Vancouver
              to Denver), and I wish I could start planning the next one.
