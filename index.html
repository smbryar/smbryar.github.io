    <h2>What did Saoirse do before?</h2>
    <p>She was a science teacher! She might have mentioned it once or twice</p>

    <h2>How did she get into coding?</h2>
    <p>Through a number of steps, listed below:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <a href="https://www.techreturners.com/">Tech Returners</a> coding
        academy, building fullstack JavaScript websites
      </li>
      <li>
        Worked for an education technology start-up called
        <a href="https://teamsos.co.uk/">TeamSOS</a>, learning C# and working in
        ASP.NET Core and Blazor
      </li>
      <li>
        Worked for a cyber security company called
        <a href="https://www.digitalinterruption.com/">Digital Interruption</a>,
        on a data science project
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>What else does she like?</h2>

    <h3>Eating and Drinking</h3>
    <p>
      I like trying lots of new foods and eating out. I also have done some
      brewing and enjoy learning to make new cocktails.
    </p>

    <h3>Singing</h3>
    <p>
      I enjoy singing in choirs and have missed that during the pandemic - it's
      not the same online.
    </p>

    <h3>Travelling</h3>
    <p>
      It's now been three years since my last big adventure (Vancouver to
      Denver), and I wish I could start planning the next one.
